#This is a minimalist home page for projects and startups.  It uses JS/HTML/CSS and deliberately avoids add-in and dependancies which may slow deployment.  The design philosopy is simple and fast. Figure out the brand, mission, create a logo, and publish. It is meant to emphasis initial brand and provide routing to other webservices.  It is intended to be run on Cloudflare, with version control by Github, and point to elements of cloud services, such GCP, Azure, AWS, or Heroku.
